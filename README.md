A simple mini project i developed while learning the basics of Google Appengine and PHP and Javascript.</br></br>
<b> About : </b> Du Connect is a web app that uses GOOGLE MAPS API to show the easiest and best route between any two colleges of Delhi University.With the help of this App, one can easily get directions from one college to another depending on his mode of travel. </br></br><b> Note</b> The App is handcoded by me in 2014 and is not responsive in nature but can be made easily by using {@mediaquery} in CSS file.</br></br>
